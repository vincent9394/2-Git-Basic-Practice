git add adds files to the Git index, which is a staging area for objects prepared to be commited.
git commit commits the files in the index to the repository, git commit -a is a shortcut to add all the modified tracked files to the index first.
git push sends all the pending changes to the remote repository to which your branch is mapped (eg. on GitHub).
